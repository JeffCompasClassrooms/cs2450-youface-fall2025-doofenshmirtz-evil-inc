Subject: Github repositories and engineering journal
Today we learned the basics of github and how to use it to create and push changes to a repository.
This is a skill I will need to learn and understand better in the future, however I feel I am starting to pick up on the basics.
Journaling will be a fun little thing to keep on top of, a good way to keep track of the things I've learned, the things I've created,
and generally be able to look back upon past successes or difficulties that I've learned from. I'll continue keeping track of the
most important events and experiences in this journal for the duration of my semester in CS2450, and likely even beyond that.
